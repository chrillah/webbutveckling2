            <h2>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
            <p>
            After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved
            his forces down south.  There was panic in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maximus was
            appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal.  Fabius, however, refused to meet
            Hannibal in the open field and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome.
            Romans were used to attacking, not hiding.  The Romans were forced to
            go on the offensive after Hannibal positioned his forces betweeen Rome and
            it's vital grain supply.  This setup the epic Battle of Cannae.  Here Hannibal
            defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
            </p>

            <p>
            The Romans were then forced to retreat to Rome.  It was a total defeat.
            </p>

            <h2>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
            <p>
            After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted
            Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in
            head on collisons.  Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but
            always at a close distance.
            </p>
            <p>
            The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost two long
            decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even then Hannibal was never
            defeated in Italy.  The Romans, adopting a tactic out of Hannibal's playbook,
            launched an attack against Carthage itself. This forced Hannibal to travel back
            to Africa to defend the city.  Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama.
